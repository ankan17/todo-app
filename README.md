# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to add new Todos, mark them as completed, and delete them. The app uses Vite bundler to bundle HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript code and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Installation

To install and run the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ankan17/todo-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd todo-app
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Type a Todo in the input field and press Enter or click the Add button.
2. Click the checkbox to mark a Todo as completed.
3. Double-click a Todo or use the edit button to edit its title.
4. Click the trash icon to delete a Todo.

## Build

To build the app for production, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a dist folder containing the bundled and minified HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Code Quality

This app uses ESLint to enforce code quality and consistency. To run ESLint, use the following command:
```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors and warnings.
